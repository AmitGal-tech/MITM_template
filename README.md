# MITM_template
ARP Spoofing Detection and Defense
Overview
This project implements a basic Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack simulation using ARP spoofing and provides a way to detect and defend against it. The script continuously monitors the ARP table to detect suspicious changes, restores the correct ARP table, and sets static ARP entries to defend against future attacks.

Features
ARP Spoofing Simulation: Spoofs ARP messages to perform a MITM attack.

ARP Spoofing Detection: Monitors the ARP table for changes in MAC addresses.

Defensive Measures:

Restores correct ARP entries.

Sets static ARP entries to prevent further attacks.

Platform Support:

Works on both Linux and Windows.

Requirements
Python 3.x

scapy library for packet crafting and sniffing.

os library for setting static ARP entries (Windows/Linux).

Installation
Step 1: Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3 installed. You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install scapy
Step 2: Running the Script
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd /path/to/your/project
Run the script:

Linux/macOS:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo python3 MITM_Defense.py
Windows: Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python MITM_Defense.py
Step 3: Testing ARP Spoofing (Optional)
To simulate an attack, uncomment the ARP spoofing loop in the code:

python
Copy
Edit
# while True:
#     arp_spoof(victim_ip, victim_mac, gateway_ip, gateway_mac)
This will start the ARP spoofing attack, and the defense mechanism will detect and restore the ARP table.

Usage
Once the script is running, it will:

Monitor the ARP table for suspicious activity.

If a MAC address change is detected, it will alert the user.

Restore the correct ARP table and set a static ARP entry to defend against further attacks.

Notes
Permissions: You may need administrator/root permissions to run the script due to the nature of ARP manipulation.

Testing: You can test this on a local network with devices you own. Never use this on unauthorized networks.

Static ARP Entries: The script automatically sets static ARP entries to prevent attacks after detection. These entries are not permanent and will need to be re-applied after a system reboot.
